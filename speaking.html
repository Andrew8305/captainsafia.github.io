                <p>
                    I love to share my knowledge and experiences with audiences on
                    stage and on the Internet. Below is a list of conferences I've
                    spoken at, as well as the topics I discussed. You'll also find a
                    smattering of podcast appearances. Videos and links are given when
                    available. Enjoy!

                                Crankshaft is the V8 JavaScript engine’s optimizing compiler, a

                                React is a front-end JavaScript framework that’s
                                grown popular over the past few years. Perhaps 
                                you’ve used React for a project before or perhaps
                                you're familiar with other front-end frameworks?
                                This talk will explore the technical implementation
                                of React, go through the pros and cons of the framework,
                                and leave the audience with a technically-backed understanding
                                of the best situations to use React in their web applications.

                                Data is a powerful storytelling tool and data visualizations

                                and computational narratives can be leveraged to present

                                can be backed by a variety of programming languages such as
                                Python, R, and Julia. In this presentation, I discuss the architecture
                                that powers this functionality.

                                In popular culture, the Turing Test is often depicted as
                                the absolute test for determining machine intelligence. However,
                                there are numerous alternatives that capture the nuances of
                                intelligence more effectively, such as the Winograd Schema Challenge.
                                In this talk, I discuss the shortcomings of the Turing test and
                                alternative metrics for measuring machine intelligence.

                            <p>
                                Unlike lower level languages, JavaScript protects us from the
                                frustrations of managing memory on the system. Nonetheless, it
                                is important for developers to have a comprehensive understanding
                                of memory allocation and how the memory allocator in JavaScript
                                works so that they can develop memory-performant code. In this talk,
                                I discuss garbage collection techniques and explain how memory
                                management works in the Node V8 engine.

                                The Jupyter Messaging Protocol is at the heart
                                of all things Jupyter. In this talk, I'll give a
                                basic run-down of the Jupyter ecosystem, how the
                                protocol (built on zeroMQ) works, and some of the
                                challenges associated with the architecture. In this
                                talk, I explore how communication is done in the scientific
                                world from both a technical and non-technical perspective.

                            <p>
                                Cleaning data is often described as the "unsexy" part of
                                data science. I don't think this is true. Scrubbing a messy
                                data set can reveal volumes about the context, history, and
                                flaws of the dataset collected and inform the data analytics
                                process. In this talk, I cover techniques that should be used
                                when approaching data cleaning and provide practical exercises
                                for attendees to complete.

                                In this 9-part workshop series, I guided students
                                through a cursory overview of the data science
                                using the Python programming language. The series
                                covered the fundamentals of programming in Python,
                                data visualization using Python tools, and machine
                                learning techniques such as Bayesian classifiers,
                                decision trees, and neural networks.

                            <p>
                                Genetic algorithms are one of the most interesting search
                                heuristics in the field of artificial intelligence and
                                go back as far as the 1950s. In this presentation, I
                                cover the history of genetic algorithms, the implementation
                                of a simple genetic algorithm, interesting use cases of genetic
                                algorithms, and the future of the technique in academia and industry.

                                Learning is the doorway to magical revelations and
                                exciting journeys. Technical education is evolving
                                beyond lecture halls and classrooms and into conference
                                rooms and Meetup spaces. As education expands into non-traditional
                                boundaries, it's important that educators of all kinds foster
                                diversity, curiosity, and empathy in the classroom, especially
                                in the technical discipline. In this talk, I explore tips and
                                techniques learned through a variety of experiences in technical
                                education, including developing empathy in the learning process,
                                fostering student collaboration, and encouraging continued exploration.

                                What's even funner than reading interesting research papers?
                                Implementing some of the techniques they describe! For some
                                programmers, this can be a daunting and nerve-wrecking process.
                                The strange symbols and the stranger jargon can be off-putting
                                to the newly-minted research paper reader. In this talk, I discuss
                                practical techniques for creating prototypal code for algorithms
                                discussed in research papers.
