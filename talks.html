                            <p>
                                Crankshaft is the V8 JavaScript engineâ€™s optimizing compiler,
                                a helpful little fellow built into the V8 engine that is designed
                                to improve the performance of our JavaScript applications.
                                But how does it work? In this talk, I deconstruct the
                                internals of the Crankshaft compiler, discuss the process
                                it goes through to optimize our code and the results of
                                these optimizations, and examine how we might leverage our
                                understanding of the internals in our day to day development work.

                                and computational narratives can be leveraged to present

                                Jupyter Notebooks allow users to create interactive documents with text,
                                images, executable code, and interactive widgets. These documents
                                can be backed by a variety of programming languages such as
                                Python, R, and Julia. In this presentation, I discuss the architecture
                                that powers this functionality.

                            <p>
                                In popular culture, the Turing Test is often depicted as
                                the absolute test for determining machine intelligence. However,
                                there are numerous alternatives that capture the nuances of
                                intelligence more effectively, such as the Winograd Schema Challenge.
                                In this talk, I discuss the shortcomings of the Turing test and
                                alternative metrics for measuring machine intelligence.

                            <p>
                                Unlike lower level languages, JavaScript protects us from the
                                frustrations of managing memory on the system. Nonetheless, it
                                is important for developers to have a comprehensive understanding
                                of memory allocation and how the memory allocator in JavaScript
                                works so that they can develop memory-performant code. In this talk,
                                I discuss garbage collection techniques and explain how memory
                                management works in the Node V8 engine.

                                The Jupyter Messaging Protocol is at the heart
                                of all things Jupyter. In this talk, I'll give a
                                basic run-down of the Jupyter ecosystem, how the
                                protocol (built on zeroMQ) works, and some of the
                                challenges associated with the architecture. In this
                                talk, I explore how communication is done in the scientific
                                world from both a technical and non-technical perspective.

                                Cleaning data is often described as the "unsexy" part of
                                data science. I don't think this is true. Scrubbing a messy
                                data set can reveal volumes about the context, history, and
                                flaws of the dataset collected and inform the data analytics
                                process. In this talk, I cover techniques that should be used
                                when approaching data cleaning and provide practical exercises
                                for attendees to complete.
